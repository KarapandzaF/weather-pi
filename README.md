# Weather-PI-Dashboard

A simple website that pulls data from FireBase and Displays it. Developed by me and a fellow student at Petnic over the a few short days. Its not really optimized having to constatnly check for changes but we agree with the limited time and JavaScript being JavaScript it wasn't worth spending all that much time over.
